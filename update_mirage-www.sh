# NOTE
# - The "hub" tool is used here to interact with GitHub.
# - We rely on "hub" to have access to user credentials via the GITHUB_USER and
#   GITHUB_PASSWORD environment variables.
# - Credentials are passed to "git" differently -- here I assume that we're
#   using GIT_ASKPASS.
#   FIXME would be useful to use single source of credentials -- such as RSA
#   keys.
# - We rely on IS_MIRAGE_BROKEN_DIR to contain the path within which we'll keep
#   a clone of GITHUB_USER's fork of mirage/mirage-www.
